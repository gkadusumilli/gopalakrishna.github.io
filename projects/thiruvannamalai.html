              <ul>
                <li><strong>Month of travel</strong>: August 2023</li>
                <li><strong>Mode of Ride</strong>: Car</li>
                <li><strong>Total distance from Kanchipuram(KMs)</strong>: 117</li>
                <li><strong>Iternary</strong>: 2 day</li>
              </ul>
  
              <p>
                Continuing the journey from Kanchipuram 🎢, the next destination was Thiruvannamalai🚗. We left Kanchipuram after breakfast 🍵 at 8:45 AM and reached Thiruvannamalai Arunchaleshwara Swamy temple Raja Gopuram at 11:15 PM.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were looking for the car parking as the place was crowded with pilgrims, asked a few people around we got to know the parking was 1 km away from the temple. A few of us offboarded near the temple, and we went to park the vehicle, but the local people were kind enough 🙂 and said to park in front of their home which was 500m away from the temple.

              </p>
              <h2> Arunchaleshwara temple - One of the Pancha buta lingams</h2>

                <li><strong>Hours spent</strong>: 1:15 mins</li>

              <p>We planned to take darshan of Arunchaleshwara Swamy, but the entrance at East Raja Gopuram was closed due to aarti & bhog timings We purchased coconut 🥥, flowers 💮, Bilwapatri from one of the local shopkeepers and left our footwear there and continued to the north entrance, as the entrance is open. <br> <br> 
                The sun ☀ was on top, the tar roads stored all the heat, and traveling barefoot was challenging, but continued by chanting om namah Shivaya. <br><br>
                
                On arrival at the north entrance, there were special darshan tickets 🎫 available, and we got them and continued entering the temple premises in the queue, due to north facing the breeze 🍃 giving us a lot of relief. At some junctions in the queue people were entering haphazardly it was a little bit difficult to form a queue. <br>
                In 45 mins ⏲, we took darshan of arunchaleshwara Swamy and a few more gods on the same premises. <br><br>
                After the darshan, we were a bit relieved and feeling of achievement that we took darshan of arunchaleshwara Swamy. <br>
                Due to the scorching heat ☀, we thought to drink some cool refreshments 🍹and then for lunch 🍚. <br>
                We continued to look for some hotels and finally reached a restaurant. 🏚 </p>

            <p>
                <h2> Lunch 🍽 </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hours spent</strong>: 40 mins</li>
                    <li><strong>Experience</strong>: &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</li>

                <br>
                <br>
            We found a restaurant, and the ambiance was very good 😘. This is one of the best restaurants I have ever visited. The owner was passionate about her work. It is evident when you enter the restaurant.
            We ordered food and discussed plans to open a similar theme-based restaurant in the future. The food tasted good.

                <h2> Giri pradakshina</h2>
                <img src="./assets/img/travel/girivalam.jpg" width="678" height="452">
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Originally, the plan was to do 14KM giri pradakshina around the hill by walking ⛰, due to an uncertain plan change at Kanchipuram and arrive at this temple at 11:30, followed by darshan of 1:30 mins. We decided to do giri pradakshina by car and after performing the pradakshina.
                We headed back to Bengaluru around 5:15 PM and reached home at 9:30 PM
                

            </p>

            <p>If I go to Arunchalam again, I have to Giri Pradakshina on a walk. It is one beautiful experience one can get.</p>
